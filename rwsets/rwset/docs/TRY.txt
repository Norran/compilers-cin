This documents provides super basic info on how to use this code.

=== From Eclipse ===

- File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace 
- Press "Next"
- From the dialog that opens, select the directory "rwsets" as the
  root directory.  Note we provide ".classpath" and ".project" Eclipse
  files.
- Run the test suite "AllTests" located under "src-tests/rwsets/"


=== From the command line ===

Use the following commands to try it out:

$> cd scripts
scripts$> ./build
scripts$> ./runRegressionTests

This will show method dependencies across a sample set of cases that
can be found under the folder "src/examples".  The script "build"
compiles the source code and generates a .jar file containing the
application under analysis (currently, those under
"src/example-apps").  Our implementation requires the subject to be
packaged this way.


enjoy,
